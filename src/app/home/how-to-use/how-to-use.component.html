    <b>Suggested strategy  for vocabulary Building :</b> <br> <br>
    This strategy is designed based on scientific evidence on how our cognition memory works and how our brain remember stuff. For Example our Visual memory is much-much better than our literature memory. It is highly probable if an image and text is shown to you for same amount of time you will be able to better recall the image than the text. Similarly our series of event memory is better than single instance memory like it is highly probable that you will forget a joke but will remember a story you heard somewhere. There could be complete book over how to effectively utilize these scientific finding to increase your brain retention capacity but we will focus on what we have come up using these theory on how to help you remember words. <br> <br>

    1. You need to make every word your friend, somehow make it relevant to you either by attaching it with some personal experience or making your own mnemonics For Example "Lassitude" which means "a state with, lack of Energy"... Now "Lassi" is an Punjabi drink which cause person to become lethargic so we make "Lassi + attitude" attitude after drinking Lassi is Lassitude. <br> <br>
    
    2. Try to prefix or sufix one another word that you already remember. for example : "Diatribe", which means "a forceful and bitter verbal attack against someone or something" you can make like "Diatribe by Trump". Now every time Diatribe comes you rather than trying to remember the meaning try to remember the attached word. You will see a lot of improvement in your learning capacity. you need to allot some time to every word to come up with these ideas. Take note of these ideas to keep them consistent through out your learning period.  <br> <br>

    3. Read about every word as much as you can like origin of word (Etymology in Merriam), go in details of synonyms, Words with similar meaning(section in Merriam) etc. There will always be something that will stuck in your memory from these. <br> <br>
    
    4. Listen to the podcast given in app, there will always be some history of word told to you, remember it as a story. <br> <br>

    5. Always focus on part of speech of words, and try to break it in root words most of the words break down to common root words while changing the meaning. <br> <br>

    6. Try to continuously enforce what you have learned by revising again and again. Most of the people make this common mistake of revising only when they are done with all the words by that time they forgot all the words. Try to be continuous in your learning and dedicate sometime every day for learning. Make it your habit to go through all the words from t-3 days before start learning new words for the day. Moreover, At the end of every week go through all the words again. Keep Marking all the words you forgot from past days and go through the details of them again to enforce the meaning. Our brain memory works based on neurons and an electrical impluse is send out to the relevant memory cells every time you revise something. This electrical impulse makes it stronger and efficent over time. So keep revising makes the cell stronger before it dies out. Generation of new neuron is follows a decay curve so try to limit the words you are learning in a day, don't go too hard or too easy follow a consistent learning path.<br> <br>

    7. Read and read lots of stuff while you are building vocabulary, it is very helpful if you find usage of a word that you just learn in some context that you are reading, it settles the meaning of word better in your brain. Continuously try to think the exact meaning of word you encounter. Refer to all the details in the GREninja app again. The NewYork times, NY times, Scientific American, arts & co daily . Try to Read wage topics that you don't understand fully. <br> <br>

    8. Continuously solve GRE questions while you are building vocabulary, don't wait for you to complete all the words, it will take a long time. We suggest you to start practicing after completing all the words in beginner Level. <br> <br>
